## React Tic-tac-toe project

This project was created from the React tutorial here: https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html

In addition to completion of the tutorial are 6 exercises for improvements on the game (supposedly in increasing order of difficulty):

[] Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
[] Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
[] Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
[] Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
[X] When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
[X] When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
