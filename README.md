## React Tic-tac-toe project

This project was created from the React tutorial here: https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html

In addition to the base tutorial there are 6 exercises for improvements on the game (supposedly in increasing order of difficulty). Tasks are stricken off upon completion:

- Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
- ~Bold the currently selected item in the move list.~
- ~Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.~
- Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- ~When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.~
- ~When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.~
